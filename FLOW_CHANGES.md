# User Flow Changes Summary

## Overview
The application flow has been enhanced to allow users to browse products without authentication while requiring login only for specific customer-tracking actions (cart, orders, payments). Additionally, onboarding screens with animations have been added to provide a better first-time user experience.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Browse Without Login Flow
- **Home/Product Pages**: Users can now browse the home page, product listings, and product details without authentication
- **Guest Cart**: Cart functionality works in guest mode, storing items locally
- **Seamless Transition**: When users login, guest cart items are merged with their user cart

### 2. Login Requirements for Specific Actions
- **Cart Access**: Users can add items to cart as guests, but checkout requires login
- **Order Management**: Order history and tracking require authentication
- **Profile/Account**: All profile-related features require authentication
- **Enhanced Login Prompts**: Replaced basic alerts with animated bottom sheets that explain the benefits of logging in

### 3. Onboarding Experience
- **First-Time User Flow**: New users see a 3-screen onboarding sequence with:
  - Welcome screen explaining the multi-store marketplace
  - Store selection and browsing features
  - Secure payment and checkout benefits
- **Smooth Animations**: Each screen features animated icons and smooth transitions
- **Skip Option**: Users can skip onboarding at any time
- **One-Time Experience**: Onboarding is shown only once per device

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- **Animated Login Dialog**: Replaced basic login prompts with visually appealing bottom sheets
- **Better Messaging**: More informative messages explaining why login is beneficial
- **Smooth Transitions**: All navigation uses smooth animations and proper state management

## File Changes

### New Files Created
- `lib/presentation/pages/shared/onboarding_page.dart` - Complete onboarding experience with animations
- `lib/core/widgets/login_dialog.dart` - Enhanced login prompts and dialogs
- `FLOW_CHANGES.md` - This documentation file

### Modified Files
- `lib/routes/app_router.dart` - Added onboarding route and updated public routes
- `lib/presentation/pages/shared/splash_page.dart` - Added onboarding flow check
- `lib/presentation/pages/customer/cart_page.dart` - Enhanced checkout login prompt
- `lib/core/constants/app_strings.dart` - Added onboarding route constant

### Cart System Enhancement
The existing `CartProvider` already had excellent guest/user cart management:
- Guest mode by default with local storage
- Automatic merging when user logs in
- Seamless transition between guest and authenticated states

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Reduced Friction**: Users can explore the app immediately without barriers
2. **Better Conversion**: Users get to see value before being asked to register
3. **Smooth Onboarding**: First-time users get a proper introduction to the app
4. **Data Preservation**: Cart items are preserved when users eventually login
5. **Clear Value Proposition**: Login prompts explain benefits rather than just demanding access

## Technical Implementation Details

- **State Management**: Uses Provider pattern for authentication and cart state
- **Local Storage**: Hive-based storage for guest cart and onboarding status
- **Routing**: Go Router handles navigation with proper authentication guards
- **Animations**: Built-in Flutter animations for smooth transitions
- **Responsive**: Works on both mobile and desktop layouts

This implementation provides a modern, user-friendly experience that encourages exploration while capturing users at the right moments in their journey.
